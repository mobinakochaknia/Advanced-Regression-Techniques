# Advanced Regression Techniques

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This Jupyter Notebook explores various **Regression Analysis** techniques, implementing and evaluating different models using Python and Scikit-learn.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **Data Preprocessing**: Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **Regression Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Ridge Regression
- **Performance Evaluation**: Using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure model performance.
- **Visualization**: Plotting results to analyze model predictions.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run each cell sequentially.
4. Observe the model performance and visualizations.

## ðŸ“Š Expected Output
- Comparisons of different regression models.
- Plots visualizing how each model fits the data.
- Evaluation metrics showing prediction errors.
